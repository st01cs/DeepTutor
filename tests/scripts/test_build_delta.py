"""Incremental runtime-pack deltas: the diff, the archive, and the fingerprint.

The fingerprint decides whether an update is safe: the Rust applier recomputes
it on the *installed* pack and refuses to patch anything that does not match
what the builder hashed. These tests pin that contract from the Python side,
including the rehydration normalisation that makes an installed pack comparable
to the tree it was built from.
